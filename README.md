# Shopping Cart

## Description

In this project, I've create a simple Shopping Cart with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to keep track of items in stock. The user can add items to their shopping cart and the quantity of items in stock will update accordingly.

The starter code was provided by MIT xPro.

## How to Run

To run this program, simply open the index.html file in your browser and add the items you desire. The items will show up in your cart and the items left in stock will update.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Future improvements will include adding pricing of the items and calculate a total in the shopping cart.
